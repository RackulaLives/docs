2. Select your format
3. Configure export options (if applicable)
4. Click **Download**

2. Enable **Export All Racks**
3. Choose format and download

</Aside>

## Importing

### From JSON backup

1. Click **Import** in the toolbar
2. Select your JSON file
3. Choose import mode:
   - **Replace**: Overwrites current project
   - **Merge**: Adds imported racks to current project

### From URL

Rackula supports loading layouts from URLs. Share a link to your hosted JSON file and others can import directly.

## Data storage

### Browser storage

Rackula stores your data in browser localStorage. This means:

- **Data persists** across browser sessions
- **Data is local** to your device and browser
- **Clearing browser data** will delete your layouts

<Aside type="caution">
  Export regularly to avoid data loss. Browser storage can be cleared by accident.
</Aside>

### Storage limits

Browser localStorage typically allows 5-10MB. This is sufficient for hundreds of racks with thousands of devices.

## Sharing layouts

### Direct sharing

1. Export your layout as JSON
2. Share the file via email, Slack, etc.
3. Recipient imports the JSON file

### Link sharing

Host your exported JSON file (GitHub Gist, Dropbox, etc.) and share the URL. Others can import directly from the URL.

## Version control

For teams, consider storing exports in Git:

```bash
# Export and commit
rackula export > homelab-rack.json
git add homelab-rack.json
git commit -m "Update rack layout"
```

This provides:
- Change history
- Collaboration via pull requests
- Rollback capability
