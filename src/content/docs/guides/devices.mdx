Devices are the building blocks of your rack layout. This guide covers everything from adding basic devices to creating custom device templates.

## Adding devices

### From the device library

1. Open the **Devices** panel in the left sidebar
2. Browse or search for a device
3. Drag the device onto your rack

### Quick add

Double-click an empty U slot in your rack to create a blank device at that position.

## Device properties

Each device has the following properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display label for the device |
| **Category** | Type classification (server, network, storage, etc.) |
| **Height** | Size in rack units (U) |
| **Notes** | Additional information or documentation |
| **Colour** | Visual colour in the rack view |

<Aside type="tip">
  Device colours are automatically assigned based on category. You can override this per device.
</Aside>

## Device categories

Rackula uses categories to organise devices and apply consistent styling:

| Category | Colour | Use for |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Server | Cyan | Compute nodes, hypervisors, NAS |
| Network | Purple | Switches, routers, firewalls |
| Storage | Green | Disk shelves, SAN arrays |
| Power | Red | PDUs, UPS, power strips |
| KVM | Orange | Console servers, KVM switches |
| AV/Media | Pink | Media servers, streaming devices |
| Cooling | Yellow | Fans, blanking panels with vents |
| Shelf | Grey | Shelves, drawers |
| Blank | Dark grey | Blanking panels, spacers |

## Editing devices

### Single device

Double-click a device to open the edit dialog. Make your changes and click **Save**.

### Bulk editing

1. Select multiple devices by holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> and clicking
2. Right-click to open the context menu
3. Choose **Edit Selected**

## Moving and resizing

### Moving

- **Drag**: Click and drag a device to reposition
- **Keyboard**: Select a device and use arrow keys to nudge

### Resizing

- **Drag edges**: Hover over the top or bottom edge and drag
- **Properties**: Edit the height value in device properties

<Aside type="caution">
  Devices cannot overlap. Rackula will prevent moves that would cause collisions.
