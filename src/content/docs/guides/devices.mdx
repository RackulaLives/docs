Devices are the building blocks of your rack layout. This guide covers everything from adding basic devices to creating custom device templates with advanced metadata.

## Device library

The device library contains all available devices for your rack layouts.

### Built-in devices

Rackula includes a starter library with 43 generic devices organised into [12 categories](/concepts/device-categories/):

- Servers (1U, 2U, 4U)
- Network equipment
- Storage devices
- Power distribution
- And more...

### Searching and filtering

1. Open the **Devices** panel in the left sidebar
2. Type in the search box to filter by name or model
3. Press **Enter** to select the first match
4. Use keyboard arrows to navigate results

{/* TODO: Screenshot of device palette with search */}

<Aside type="tip">
  Devices are grouped by category. Expand/collapse groups by clicking the category header.
</Aside>

### Drag-and-drop placement

<Steps>

1. Find a device in the library
2. Click and drag the device toward your rack
3. Position indicators show valid drop locations
4. Release to place the device

</Steps>

The device snaps to the nearest valid U position. Invalid positions (collisions) are highlighted.

## Adding devices

### From the library

1. Open the **Devices** panel in the left sidebar
2. Browse or search for a device
3. Drag the device onto your rack

### Quick add

Double-click an empty U slot in your rack to create a blank device at that position.

## Device properties

### Basic properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display label for the device |
| **Model** | Model number or identifier |
| **Manufacturer** | Device manufacturer |
| **Category** | Type classification (determines default colour) |
| **Notes** | Documentation and comments |

### Physical properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|

| **Rear** | Hidden | Visible | Rear-mount only equipment |
| **Both** | Visible | Visible | Full-depth equipment |

<Aside>
  Half-depth devices with face set to "Front" or "Rear" allow another half-depth device to occupy the opposite face at the same U position.
</Aside>

### Airflow

Set the device's airflow direction for thermal planning:

| Direction | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Passive** | No active cooling |
| **Front-to-rear** | Standard server airflow |
| **Rear-to-front** | Some network equipment |
| **Left-to-right** | Side intake |

## Creating custom devices

<Steps>

1. **Open device library**

   Click the device library button or use the sidebar.

2. **Click "Add Device"**

   Find the add button at the bottom of the library.

3. **Enter basic details**

   - Name (required)
   - Model and manufacturer
   - Category

4. **Set dimensions**

   - U height (0.5U increments supported)
   - Full-depth toggle

5. **Add images (optional)**

   Upload front and/or rear images for visual representation.

6. **Save device**

   The device appears in your library, ready for placement.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  **Image guidelines:** Use PNG or JPEG images. Ideal dimensions match the device's U height ratio. Transparent backgrounds work best for non-rectangular equipment.
</Aside>

## Device images

### Bundled images

Rackula includes images for many devices in brand packs. These show automatically when you use devices from brand packs.

### Custom images per device type

When creating a custom device, you can add default front and rear images that apply to all placements.

### Image override per placement

Override images for specific placements:

1. Select the placed device
2. Open the edit panel
3. Scroll to the Images section
4. Upload a custom image

This is useful when the same device type has visual variations (different faceplates, labels, etc.).

### Image indicators

In the device library, icons indicate image availability:

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 📷 | Front image available |
| 📷📷 | Front and rear images |
| — | No images (placeholder shown) |

## Editing devices

### Single device

<Steps>

1. **Select the device**

   Click on the device in your rack.

2. **Open edit panel**

   Double-click, or click **Edit** in the toolbar.

3. **Make changes**

   Update any properties.

4. **Save**

   Click **Save** or press **Enter**.

</Steps>

### Multi-device selection

1. Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and click additional devices
2. Or drag a selection box around multiple devices
3. Selected devices highlight together
4. Edit applies to all selected devices

## Moving devices

### Drag to move

Click and drag a device to reposition within the rack. Position indicators show valid drop locations.

### Keyboard movement

Select a device and use:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| <kbd>↑</kbd> | Move up 1U |
| <kbd>↓</kbd> | Move down 1U |

### Leapfrog behaviour

When moving with keyboard, devices **leapfrog** over obstacles:

- If the target position is blocked, the device jumps to the next available position
- This prevents devices from getting stuck behind others
- Movement stops at rack boundaries

<Aside>
  Leapfrog makes keyboard navigation faster—you don't need to manually navigate around obstacles.
</Aside>

### Collision detection

Rackula prevents device overlap:

- Invalid positions are highlighted during drag
- Drops are rejected if they would cause collisions
- Consider device face (front/rear/both) when planning
- Half-depth devices can share U positions with opposite-face devices

## Copying and duplicating

### Duplicate device

1. Select a device
2. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> on Mac)
3. The duplicate appears offset from the original
4. Drag to final position

### Copy between racks

1. Select device(s)
2. Switch to target rack (tabs or sidebar)
3. Paste with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>

## Deleting devices

| Method | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Keyboard | Select and press <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> |
| Context menu | Right-click → Delete |
| Edit panel | Click Delete button |

<Aside type="tip">
  All deletions can be undone with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>.
</Aside>

## Undo and redo

Device operations support full undo/redo:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> | Undo last action |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> | Redo |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd> | Redo (alternative) |

Undoable operations include:
- Place device
- Move device
- Remove device
- Update device properties
- Update device face or name
