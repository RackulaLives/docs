Racks are containers for your devices. This guide covers rack creation, configuration, and management.

## Creating a rack

1. Click **New Rack** in the toolbar
2. Enter a name for your rack
3. Set the height in rack units (U)
4. Click **Create**

### Common rack sizes

| Size | Use case |
|------|----------|
| 42U | Full-height data centre rack |
| 25U | Half-height or open frame rack |
| 12U | Small wall-mount or desktop rack |
| 4U | Mini rack or portable enclosure |

## Rack properties

### Basic settings

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display label for the rack |
| **Height** | Total height in rack units |
| **Starting U** | First U number (usually 1) |
| **Numbering** | Top-down or bottom-up |

### Display options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Show U numbers** | Display U position labels |
| **Show grid** | Display grid lines between U positions |
| **Show device names** | Display device labels in rack view |

<Aside type="tip">
  Most racks number from the bottom up (U1 at the bottom). Some data centres use top-down numbering.

## Multiple racks

Rackula supports multiple racks in a single project. This is useful for:

- Multi-rack deployments
- Before/after comparisons
- Planning migrations

### Adding additional racks

Click **New Rack** to add another rack to your project. Each rack is independent and can have different heights and settings.

### Rack arrangement

Drag rack tabs to reorder them in the tab bar. The display order affects how racks appear in exports.

## Renaming and deleting

### Rename

Double-click the rack tab or open rack settings and edit the name.

### Delete

1. Right-click the rack tab
2. Select **Delete Rack**
3. Confirm the deletion

<Aside type="caution">
  Deleting a rack removes all devices in that rack. This cannot be undone.
