Racks are containers for your devices. This guide covers rack creation, configuration, and all available settings.

## Creating a rack

<Steps>

1. **Click "New Rack"**

   Find the New Rack button in the toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut.

2. **Enter a name**

   Give your rack a descriptive name (e.g., "Primary Server Rack", "Network Closet").

3. **Select rack width**

   Choose from standard widths:
   - **19"** — Standard rack (most common)
   - **23"** — Telco/data centre rack
   - **10"** — Small desktop/DeskPi rack

4. **Set the height**

   Pick from presets or enter a custom height (1–100U).

5. **Click "Create"**

   Your new rack appears on the canvas, ready for devices.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  The default name "Racky McRackface" is a placeholder — rename it to something meaningful for your setup.
</Aside>

## Rack sizes

### Standard heights

| Size | Use case |
|------|----------|
| **42U** | Full-height data centre rack |
| **24U** | Half-height rack, medium deployments |
| **18U** | Compact rack, small server rooms |
| **12U** | Wall-mount or small homelab |

### Small form factor (10" racks)

10-inch racks have limited height options to match their smaller form factor:

| Size | Use case |
|------|----------|
| **12U** | Desktop homelab rack |
| **8U** | Network equipment enclosure |
| **6U** | Small network closet |
| **4U** | Mini portable enclosure |

### Custom heights

Enter any height from 1U to 100U for non-standard requirements. This is useful for:

- Documenting partial rack allocations
- Planning custom enclosures
- Mapping unusual equipment configurations

## Rack widths

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="19-inch (Standard)">
    The most common rack width, used by virtually all IT equipment.

    - **External width:** 19 inches (482.6mm)
    - **Mounting width:** 17.75 inches (450.85mm) between rails
    - **Use for:** Servers, storage, networking, most rack-mount equipment
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="23-inch (Telco)">
    Used in telecommunications and some older data centres.

    - **External width:** 23 inches (584.2mm)
    - **Mounting width:** 19 inches between rails
    - **Use for:** Telco equipment, legacy installations
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="10-inch (Half-width)">
    Compact racks for small installations and desktop homelabs.

    - **External width:** 10 inches (254mm)
    - **Use for:** Network switches, small servers, DeskPi setups
    - **Height limit:** 4U–12U typically
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside>
  Most homelab equipment uses 19-inch racks. Only select 23-inch or 10-inch if you have specific equipment that requires it.
</Aside>

## Form factors

Rackula supports five rack form factors, matching the [rack types](/concepts/rack-types/) in your physical setup:

| Form Factor | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **2-Post** | Two vertical rails, no rear support |
| **4-Post** | Front and rear mounting rails |
| **4-Post Cabinet** | Enclosed 4-post with doors and panels |
| **Wall-Mount** | Wall-mounted enclosure |
| **Open Frame** | Open 4-post without side panels |

The form factor affects the visual representation in Rackula but doesn't restrict device placement.

## Rack properties

### Basic settings

| Property | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Display label for the rack | "Racky McRackface" |
| **Height** | Total height in rack units | 42U |
| **Width** | Rail width (10", 19", 23") | 19" |
| **Form Factor** | Physical rack type | 4-Post Cabinet |

### U numbering

Configure how U positions are numbered:

| Setting | U1 Position | Common use |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Bottom-up** (default) | Bottom of rack | Most data centres |
| **Top-down** | Top of rack | Some enterprise standards |

<Aside type="tip">
  Check your organisation's rack documentation standards. Most homelabs use bottom-up numbering, but some enterprise environments require top-down.
</Aside>

### Starting unit

The first U number in your rack. Default is 1, but you can change this for:

- **Continuation racks** — Start at 41 if documenting U41–84 of a tall rack
- **Offset installations** — Match physical labelling on existing equipment
- **Multi-section documentation** — Split a large rack into separate Rackula racks

### Display options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Show rear** | Display rear view on canvas | Enabled |

When "Show rear" is disabled, only the front view appears on the canvas. This is useful for:

- Simplified documentation
- Focusing on front-facing equipment
- Smaller canvas when rear placement isn't needed

## Editing rack settings

<Steps>

1. **Select the rack**

   Click on the rack background (not a device) or click the rack name in the tab.

2. **Open the edit panel**

   The properties panel shows rack settings when a rack is selected.

3. **Modify settings**

   Change name, height, numbering, or display options.

4. **Changes apply immediately**

   Updates are saved automatically.

</Steps>

### Changing rack height

You can resize a rack at any time with some constraints:

- **Growing** — Always allowed (add more U positions)
- **Shrinking** — Blocked if devices would be cut off

<Aside type="caution">
  If shrinking is blocked, Rackula shows which devices conflict. Move or remove those devices first, then resize.
</Aside>

**Quick resize buttons** in the edit panel offer common heights (12U, 18U, 24U, 42U) for fast adjustments.

## Rack notes

Add documentation notes to your rack:

1. Select the rack
2. Find the **Notes** field in the edit panel
3. Enter relevant information:
   - Location details
   - Power specifications
   - Cooling requirements
   - Asset information

Notes are saved with your layout and exported with documentation.

## Multiple racks

<Aside>
  Multi-rack support is planned for a future version. Currently, Rackula supports one rack per layout.
</Aside>

### Current workflow for multiple racks

Until multi-rack support arrives, you can:

1. **Create separate layouts** — One layout per rack, exported separately
2. **Use naming conventions** — "DC1-Row2-Rack4" to identify physical locations
3. **Export and combine** — Export images and combine in external tools

### Planned features

Future versions will support:

- Multiple racks per layout
- Rack arrangement and positioning
- Cross-rack cabling documentation
- Multi-rack exports

## Deleting a rack

<Steps>

1. **Select the rack**

   Click on the rack background.

2. **Open rack settings**

   Find the delete option in the edit panel.

3. **Confirm deletion**

   Removing a rack also removes all devices in that rack.

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  In the current single-rack mode, deleting the rack clears all devices. This action cannot be undone — save your work first.
</Aside>

## Best practices

### Naming conventions

Use consistent naming that includes:

- **Location** — Data centre, room, row
- **Identifier** — Rack number or position
- **Purpose** — Function or department

Examples:
- "DC1-R1-01" (Data Centre 1, Row 1, Rack 01)
- "Homelab-Primary"
- "Network-Closet-Building-A"

### Height selection

Choose rack height based on:

1. **Physical rack size** — Match your actual equipment
2. **Growth planning** — Leave room for expansion
3. **Documentation scope** — Document what's relevant

### U numbering direction

| Scenario | Recommended |
|----------|-------------|
| New homelab | Bottom-up (default) |
| Matching existing labels | Whatever's on the rack |
| Enterprise environment | Check your standards |
| Mixed environment | Pick one and be consistent |
