A **rack unit** (abbreviated **U** or **RU**) is the standard unit of measurement for the height of equipment designed to mount in a 19-inch server rack.

## What is a rack unit?

One rack unit equals **1.75 inches (44.45mm)** in height. This standard was established by the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA-310) and is used globally.

| Units | Height (inches) | Height (mm) | Height (cm) |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1U | 1.75" | 44.45mm | 4.45cm |
| 2U | 3.5" | 88.9mm | 8.89cm |
| 3U | 5.25" | 133.35mm | 13.34cm |
| 4U | 7" | 177.8mm | 17.78cm |

<Aside type="tip">
  **Quick calculation:** Multiply the U count by 1.75 to get inches, or by 44.45 to get millimetres.

## Common equipment sizes

| Equipment type | Typical size | Notes |
|----------------|--------------|-------|
| 1U server | 1U | Most common server form factor |
| Standard switch | 1U | Network switches, patch panels |
| 2U server | 2U | More drive bays, better cooling |
| 4U server | 4U | High-performance, storage-heavy |
| UPS | 2U–6U | Varies by capacity |
| PDU | 0U–2U | Often mounted vertically (0U) |

## U position numbering

Rack positions are numbered sequentially, with each number representing one U of space.

### Bottom-up numbering (most common)

The most widely used convention numbers from the bottom:

```
┌─────────────┐
│ U42         │ ← Top of rack
│ U41         │
│ ...         │
│ U2          │
│ U1          │ ← Bottom of rack
└─────────────┘
```

**Advantages:**
- U1 is always at floor level
- Consistent reference point regardless of rack height
- Heavy equipment naturally placed at the bottom

### Top-down numbering

Some data centres number from the top:

```
┌─────────────┐
│ U1          │ ← Top of rack
│ U2          │
│ ...         │
│ U41         │
│ U42         │ ← Bottom of rack
└─────────────┘
```

<Aside>
  Rackula supports both numbering conventions. Configure this in rack settings under **Numbering direction**.

## Device placement

When placing a multi-U device, the **starting position** is the **lowest U it occupies**.

For example, a 2U server at position U10:
- Occupies U10 and U11
- U10 is the "mounting position"
- U11 is covered by the device

```
┌─────────────┐
│ U12         │ (empty)
│ U11         │ ┐
│ U10         │ ┘ 2U Server (position: U10)
│ U9          │ (empty)
└─────────────┘
```

## Half-rack units

Some equipment uses **half-rack heights**:

| Size | Height | Examples |
|------|--------|----------|
| 0.5U | 0.875" (22.2mm) | Thin switches, KVM |
| 1.5U | 2.625" (66.7mm) | Some Dell servers |

<Aside type="caution">
  Half-U devices create gaps that can affect airflow. Use blanking panels or filler panels to maintain proper cooling.
</Aside>

Rackula supports half-U devices. Set the device height to `0.5`, `1.5`, etc.

## Rack height standards

Common full-rack heights:

| Height | Use case |
|--------|----------|
| 42U | Standard data centre rack |
| 45U | Extended height rack |
| 48U | Tall data centre rack |
| 25U | Half-height rack |
| 22U | Audio/video rack |
| 12U | Wall-mount rack |
| 6U | Desktop/portable rack |
| 4U | Mini rack |
