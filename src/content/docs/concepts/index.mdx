## Quick reference

### Common rack sizes

| Size | Height | Typical use |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 42U | 73.5" (1.87m) | Data centre standard |

| 12U | 21" (53cm) | Wall-mount |
| 6U | 10.5" (27cm) | Desktop/small |

### Device category colours

Rackula uses consistent colours to identify device types:

|----------|--------|----------|
| Server | Cyan | Compute nodes, hypervisors |
| Network | Purple | Switches, routers, firewalls |
| Storage | Green | NAS, SAN, disk shelves |
| Power | Red | PDU, UPS |
| KVM | Orange | Console servers |
| AV/Media | Pink | Media servers |
| Cooling | Yellow | Fans, AC units |

### Airflow directions

| Direction | Symbol | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Front-to-rear | → | Standard server airflow |
| Rear-to-front | ← | Some network equipment |
| Side-to-rear | ↗ | Some 1U switches |
| Passive | — | No active cooling |
