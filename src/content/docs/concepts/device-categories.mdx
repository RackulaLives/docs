Rackula organises devices into **12 categories** to help you visualise and document your rack layouts. Each category has a default colour for quick identification.

## Active categories

These categories represent equipment that actively processes, stores, or distributes data and power.

### Server

**Colour:** Cyan (`#8BE9FD`)

Compute equipment including:
- Rack-mount servers (1U, 2U, 4U)
- Blade chassis
- Hypervisors and virtualisation hosts
- GPU compute nodes

### Network

**Colour:** Purple (`#BD93F9`)

Networking infrastructure:
- Ethernet switches
- Routers and firewalls
- Load balancers
- Wireless access point controllers

### Storage

**Colour:** Green (`#50FA7B`)

Data storage systems:
- NAS (Network Attached Storage)
- SAN (Storage Area Network)
- Disk shelves and JBODs
- Tape libraries

### Power

**Colour:** Red (`#FF5555`)

Power distribution and protection:
- PDU (Power Distribution Unit)
- UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)
- ATS (Automatic Transfer Switch)
- Power meters

<Aside type="caution">
  Power equipment is highlighted in red to draw attention—these are critical infrastructure components.
</Aside>

### KVM

**Colour:** Orange (`#FFB86C`)

Console and remote access:
- KVM switches
- Console servers
- Serial concentrators
- IP-based remote access

### AV/Media

**Colour:** Pink (`#FF79C6`)

Audio, video, and media equipment:
- Media servers
- Video encoders/decoders
- Audio processors
- Streaming equipment

### Cooling

**Colour:** Yellow (`#F1FA8C`)

Environmental control:
- Rack-mount fans
- In-row cooling units
- Environmental monitors
- Temperature sensors

## Passive categories

These categories represent equipment that doesn't actively process data but serves important infrastructure functions.

### Patch Panel

**Colour:** Grey (`#6272A4`)

Cable termination:
- Copper patch panels
- Fibre patch panels
- Cable management bars

### Shelf

**Colour:** Grey (`#6272A4`)

Non-rack-mount equipment support:
- Keyboard/mouse trays
- Equipment shelves
- Monitor shelves
- Sliding shelves

### Blank

**Colour:** Dark grey (`#44475A`)

Space fillers:
- Blanking panels
- Filler panels
- Vent panels

<Aside type="tip">
  Use blanking panels to fill empty U spaces. This prevents hot air recirculation and improves cooling efficiency.
</Aside>

### Cable Management

**Colour:** Grey (`#6272A4`)

Cable organisation:
- Vertical cable managers
- Horizontal cable organisers
- Cable rings and hooks
- Cable ducts

### Other

**Colour:** Grey (`#6272A4`)

Anything that doesn't fit other categories:
- Custom equipment
- Unusual form factors
- Specialty devices

## Category colours in Rackula

### Default colours

Rackula assigns colours automatically based on category. The colour scheme uses the Dracula palette:

| Category | Dracula (dark) | Alucard (light) |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Server | `#8BE9FD` | `#036A96` |
| Network | `#BD93F9` | `#644AC9` |
| Storage | `#50FA7B` | `#14710A` |
| Power | `#FF5555` | `#CB3A2A` |
| KVM | `#FFB86C` | `#A34D14` |
| AV/Media | `#FF79C6` | `#A3144D` |
| Cooling | `#F1FA8C` | `#846E15` |
| Passive* | `#6272A4` | `#6C664B` |

*Passive categories (Patch Panel, Shelf, Cable Management, Other) share the same muted colour.

### Custom colours

You can override the category colour on individual devices:

1. Select the device
2. Open the edit panel
3. Click the colour swatch
4. Choose a custom colour

Custom colours help distinguish similar equipment (e.g., production vs. development servers).

## Filtering by category

In the device library:
- Categories appear as collapsible groups
- Devices are automatically sorted by category
- Use search to filter across all categories

## Choosing categories

When adding custom devices, choose the category that best describes the **primary function**:

| If the device primarily... | Choose |
|---------------------------|--------|
| Runs applications/VMs | Server |
| Routes/switches network traffic | Network |
| Stores data | Storage |
| Distributes/protects power | Power |
| Provides console access | KVM |
| Handles audio/video | AV/Media |
| Manages airflow | Cooling |
| Terminates cables | Patch Panel |
| Supports non-rack equipment | Shelf |
| Fills empty space | Blank |
| Organises cables | Cable Management |
| Doesn't fit above | Other |
