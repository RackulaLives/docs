Server racks come in various form factors, each suited to different environments and equipment. Understanding these types helps you plan layouts that match your physical infrastructure.

## Form factors

Rackula supports five rack form factors:

### 2-Post Rack

A simple frame with two vertical posts.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Structure** | Two vertical rails |
| **Best for** | Networking equipment, patch panels |
| **Depth** | Shallow (no rear support) |
| **Cost** | Lowest |

**Typical use:** Telecom closets, network distribution points.

<Aside type="caution">
  2-post racks cannot support heavy servers. Use 4-post racks for compute equipment.
</Aside>

### 4-Post Rack

The standard server rack with front and rear mounting rails.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Structure** | Four vertical rails (front and rear) |
| **Best for** | Servers, storage arrays |
| **Depth** | Full depth (adjustable) |
| **Cost** | Moderate |

**Typical use:** Data centres, server rooms, homelabs.

### 4-Post Cabinet

A 4-post rack enclosed in a cabinet with doors and side panels.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Structure** | Enclosed 4-post frame |
| **Best for** | Office environments, security |
| **Features** | Lockable doors, cable management |
| **Cost** | Higher |

**Typical use:** Offices, retail locations, anywhere physical security matters.

### Wall-Mount Rack

A rack designed to mount directly to a wall.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Structure** | Wall-mounted frame |
| **Height** | Usually 6U–18U |
| **Depth** | Shallow to medium |
| **Best for** | Small installations, network closets |

**Typical use:** Small offices, home network equipment.

<Aside>
  Wall-mount racks often swing open for rear access. Account for this clearance when planning.
</Aside>

### Open Frame

A 4-post rack without side panels or enclosure.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Structure** | Open 4-post frame |
| **Best for** | Airflow, easy access |
| **Features** | Maximum cooling, visible equipment |
| **Cost** | Lower than cabinets |

**Typical use:** Data centres with hot/cold aisle containment, labs.

## Rack widths

### 19-inch (standard)

The vast majority of rack-mount equipment uses the 19-inch standard:
- **External width:** 19 inches (482.6mm)
- **Mounting width:** 17.75 inches (450.85mm) between rails

### 23-inch (telco)

Used primarily in telecommunications:
- **External width:** 23 inches (584.2mm)
- Less common in IT environments

### 10-inch (half-width)

Used for small installations:
- **External width:** 10 inches (254mm)
- Common for home network equipment

<Aside type="tip">
  Most homelab equipment uses 19-inch racks. Only select 23-inch or 10-inch if you have specific equipment requirements.
</Aside>

## Rack depths

Rack depth determines what equipment can fit:

| Depth | Range | Suitable for |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| Shallow | 12"–18" | Network switches, patch panels |
| Medium | 24"–30" | 1U servers, some storage |
| Deep | 36"–42" | Full-size servers, storage arrays |
| Extra deep | 44"–48" | High-density servers |

<Aside type="caution">
  Always check equipment depth before purchasing a rack. Deep servers in shallow racks won't fit.
</Aside>

## Choosing a rack type

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Homelab">
    **Recommended:** 4-post rack or open frame (12U–42U)

    - Open frame for maximum cooling
    - 4-post for stability
    - Consider noise if rack is in living space
    - Wall-mount for small setups (networking only)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Office">
    **Recommended:** 4-post cabinet (25U–42U)

    - Enclosed for noise reduction
    - Lockable for security
    - Cable management options
    - Consider ventilation requirements
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Data Centre">
    **Recommended:** 4-post rack or open frame (42U–48U)

    - Standardise on one type
    - Hot/cold aisle compatibility
    - Cable management trays
    - PDU mounting positions
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## In Rackula

Configure your rack type when creating a new rack:

1. Click **New Rack**
2. Select **Form Factor** from the dropdown
3. Rackula adapts the visual representation

The form factor affects:
- Visual appearance in the rack view
- Available mounting options
- Default width setting
