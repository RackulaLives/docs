## Display modes

Rackula offers three display modes. Toggle with the **I** key or toolbar button.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Labels">
    Devices show their names as text. Best for documentation and clarity.

    - Clear device identification
    - Compact display
    - Works at all zoom levels
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Images">
    Devices show their images only. Best for realistic visualisation.

    - Manufacturer device images
    - Front and rear views
    - Placeholder for devices without images
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Image + Labels">
    Devices show images with name overlay. Best of both worlds.

    - Visual identification
    - Name labelling
    - Good for presentations
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Themes

Rackula supports dark and light themes.

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Dracula** (dark) | Default. Purple accents on dark background. |
| **Alucard** (light) | Warm cream background with purple accents. |

Toggle themes using the moon/sun icon in the toolbar. Your preference is saved.

## Mobile experience

Rackula works on tablets but is optimised for desktop use. On smaller screens:

- Sidebar becomes a drawer (tap hamburger menu)
- Touch and drag to position devices
- Long-press for context menus
- Pinch to zoom on touch devices

<Aside type="caution">
  For the best experience, use a device with at least a 1024px wide screen. Phones are not recommended for rack editing.
