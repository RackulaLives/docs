import { Steps, Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This tutorial walks you through creating a complete rack layout from scratch. By the end, you'll have a documented 42U rack with servers, networking, and power distribution.

## Before you start

You'll need:
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Your rack dimensions and equipment list (optional but helpful)

<Aside type="tip">
  **Not sure about your rack size?** Most full-height server racks are 42U. Wall-mount racks are typically 6U–12U. Measure your physical rack if you're documenting existing equipment.
</Aside>

## Step 1: Create your rack

<Steps>

1. **Open Rackula**

   Navigate to [count.racku.la](https://count.racku.la). You'll see a welcome screen on your first visit.

   {/* TODO: Screenshot of welcome screen */}

2. **Click "New Rack"**

   Find the **New Rack** button in the toolbar at the top of the screen.

   {/* TODO: Screenshot highlighting New Rack button */}

3. **Configure your rack**

   In the dialog that appears, enter:

   | Setting | Example value | Notes |
   |---------|--------------|-------|
   | **Name** | Main Server Rack | A label for your rack |
   | **Height** | 42 | Total height in rack units |
   | **Width** | 19" | Standard rack width |
   | **Form factor** | 4-post | Most common type |

4. **Click "Create"**

   Your empty rack appears on the canvas, ready for devices.

   {/* TODO: Screenshot of empty 42U rack */}

</Steps>

## Step 2: Add your first device

Let's add a 2U server to the rack.

<Steps>

1. **Open the device library**

   Click the **Devices** button in the left sidebar, or press the sidebar toggle.

   {/* TODO: Screenshot of sidebar with device library */}

2. **Find a server**

   Use the search box to filter devices, or browse by category. Look for **2U Server** in the Server category.

3. **Drag to your rack**

   Click and drag the device from the library onto your rack. As you drag, you'll see position indicators showing where the device will land.

   {/* TODO: Screenshot of drag-and-drop in progress */}

4. **Drop at position**

   Release the mouse button to place the device. The device snaps to the nearest valid U position.

</Steps>

<Aside>
  **Collision detection:** Rackula prevents devices from overlapping. If you try to drop a device where another exists, it will find the nearest valid position.
</Aside>

## Step 3: Customise the device

<Steps>

1. **Select the device**

   Click on the device you just placed. It highlights to show it's selected.

2. **Open the edit panel**

   Double-click the device, or click the **Edit** button that appears when selected.

3. **Update device details**

   | Field | Example | Purpose |
   |-------|---------|---------|
   | **Name** | TrueNAS | Display name in rack view |
   | **Category** | Storage | Determines default colour |
   | **Notes** | 64GB RAM, 8x 4TB | Your documentation |

4. **Change the colour (optional)**

   Click the colour swatch to choose a custom colour, or leave it to use the category default.

5. **Save changes**

   Click **Save** or press Enter to apply your changes.

</Steps>

## Step 4: Build out your rack

Now add more equipment. A typical homelab rack might include:

### Networking (top of rack)

| Position | Device | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| U42 | Patch panel | Cable termination |
| U41 | 24-port switch | Main network switch |
| U40 | Firewall/router | pfSense, OPNsense, etc. |

### Servers (middle)

| Position | Device | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| U35–36 | 2U server | Hypervisor |
| U33–34 | 2U server | NAS |
| U31–32 | 2U server | Backup |

### Power (bottom)

| Position | Device | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| U1–2 | UPS | Battery backup |
| U3 | PDU | Power distribution |

<Aside type="tip">
  **Hot aisle/cold aisle:** Place intake fans (front) facing the cold aisle. Server exhaust should face the hot aisle. Use blanking panels to prevent hot air recirculation.
</Aside>

## Step 5: Switch views

Rackula supports both front and rear rack views.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Front view">
    Shows devices as seen from the front of the rack. This is the default view.

    - Device fronts and fascias
    - U position labels
    - Device names
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Rear view">
    Shows devices as seen from the back of the rack.

    - Cable management
    - Power connections
    - Rear-mounted equipment

    Click the **Front/Rear** toggle in the toolbar to switch views.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 6: Export your layout

Once your rack is complete, export it for documentation.

<Steps>

1. **Click "Export"**

   Find the Export button in the toolbar.

2. **Choose your format**

   | Format | Best for |
   |--------|----------|
   | **PNG** | Documentation, sharing, presentations |
   | **SVG** | Scalable graphics, editing in design tools |
   | **PDF** | Printing, formal documentation |
   | **CSV** | Spreadsheet import, inventory tracking |

3. **Configure options**

   - **Background:** Dark, light, or transparent
   - **Include legend:** Adds a colour key for device categories
   - **Include QR code:** Adds a scannable link to your layout

4. **Download**

   Click **Export** to download your file.

</Steps>

## Step 7: Save and share

### Auto-save

Rackula automatically saves your work to browser localStorage. Your layout persists across browser sessions.

### Manual backup

For reliable backups, export your layout as JSON:
1. Click **Export**
2. Select **JSON** format
3. Save the file somewhere safe

### Share with others

Generate a shareable link:
1. Click **Share** in the toolbar
2. Copy the generated URL
3. Anyone with the link can view your layout

<Aside type="caution">
  **Browser storage warning:** Clearing your browser data will delete your saved layouts. Always keep JSON backups of important work.
</Aside>
