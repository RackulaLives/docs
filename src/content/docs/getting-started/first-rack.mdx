This guide walks through creating a complete rack layout from scratch. By the end, you'll have a documented rack ready to export.

## Before you start

You'll need:
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Knowledge of your rack dimensions and equipment

<Aside type="tip">
  Measure your physical rack in U (rack units). One U equals 1.75 inches or 44.45mm.
</Aside>

## Creating the rack

<Steps>

1. **Open Rackula**

   Navigate to [count.racku.la](https://count.racku.la).

2. **Create a new rack**

   Click the **New Rack** button in the toolbar. Enter:
   - **Name**: A label for your rack (e.g., "Main Server Rack")
   - **Height**: The total U height (e.g., 42)

3. **Configure rack settings**

   Optional: Set the rack width and depth if you need precise dimensions for your documentation.

</Steps>

## Adding devices

<Steps>

1. **Open the device library**

   Click the **Devices** panel on the left sidebar.

2. **Select a device category**

   Choose from servers, networking, storage, power, or other categories.

3. **Drag to position**

   Drag the device onto your rack. Drop it at the desired U position.

4. **Adjust size**

   Resize the device by dragging its edges to match your actual equipment's U height.

5. **Edit details**

   Double-click the device to edit its name, notes, and other properties.

</Steps>

## Exporting your layout

Once your rack is complete:

1. Click **Export** in the toolbar
2. Choose your format:
   - **PNG**: For documentation and sharing
   - **SVG**: For scalable graphics and editing
   - **PDF**: For printing and formal documentation

<Aside>
  Your rack data is stored locally in your browser. Consider exporting a backup regularly.
