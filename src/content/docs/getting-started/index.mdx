## Getting started

<Steps>

1. **Open Rackula**

   Go to [count.racku.la](https://count.racku.la). The app loads instantly in your browser—no installation required.

2. **Create your first rack**

   Click **New Rack** in the toolbar. Set your rack height in U (rack units). Common sizes:
   - **42U** — Full-height data centre rack
   - **25U** — Half-height rack
   - **12U** — Wall-mount or desktop rack

3. **Add devices**

   Open the device library in the sidebar. Drag devices onto your rack and drop them at the desired U position.

4. **Customise your devices**

   Double-click any device to edit its name, category, and colour. Resize devices by dragging their edges.

5. **Save your work**

   Your layout auto-saves to browser storage. For backups, click **Export** and download as JSON, or use **Share** to generate a shareable URL.

</Steps>

  Rackula stores your data locally in your browser. Export regularly to avoid losing work if you clear browser data.

## Understanding rack units

A **rack unit (U)** is the standard unit of measurement for server rack equipment. One U equals 1.75 inches (44.45mm) in height.

| Equipment | Typical height |
|-----------|---------------|
| 1U server | 1U |
| Standard switch | 1U |
| 2U server | 2U |
| UPS | 2U–6U |
| NAS | 1U–4U |
